We are using the Strategy Pattern to calculate tax based on country.

So instead of:

```ts


if (country === 'IN') tax = amount * 0.18;
else if (country === 'US') tax = amount * 0.07;
```
We‚Äôre doing this the clean way ‚Äî with reusable classes, each handling its own logic.

üîç Code Explanation (Line by Line)
1. Define a common interface
```ts

interface TaxStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number;
}
```
This is the base interface that all tax strategies will follow.
Every country‚Äôs tax logic will implement this .calculate() method.
So PaymentProcessor doesn‚Äôt care how tax is calculated ‚Äî it just calls calculate().

2. Create individual tax strategy classes
ts
```
class IndiaTax implements TaxStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return amount * 0.18;
  }
}
```
This class handles India‚Äôs tax rule (18% GST).
It implements the TaxStrategy interface and defines how to calculate the tax.

Similarly:

```ts

class USTax implements TaxStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return amount * 0.07;
  }
}
```

```ts

class UKTax implements TaxStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return amount * 0.2;
  }
}
```
These are modular, isolated units ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the core benefit of the Strategy Pattern.

3. Create the context class: PaymentProcessor
```ts

class PaymentProcessor {
  constructor(private strategy: TaxStrategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

```
The constructor takes a TaxStrategy ‚Äî this is dependency injection.
Now, this class doesn‚Äôt know which country‚Äôs logic it‚Äôs using ‚Äî it just uses whatever it's given.

```ts

  setStrategy(strategy: TaxStrategy): void {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }
```
This allows you to switch strategies at runtime if needed.

```ts

  processPayment(amount: number): void {
    const tax = this.strategy.calculate(amount);
    const total = amount + tax;
    console.log("--------");
    console.log(`Base Amount: ${amount}`);
    console.log(`Tax Applied: ${tax}`);
    console.log(`Total: ${total}`);
    console.log("--------\n");
  }
}

```
Here, we use the strategy to calculate tax and show the total.
The PaymentProcessor class doesn‚Äôt know what country it‚Äôs working for ‚Äî and it doesn‚Äôt need to.

4. Usage
```ts
const indiaPayment = new PaymentProcessor(new IndiaTax());
indiaPayment.processPayment(1000);
```
We pass IndiaTax to the processor

It calculates 18% GST and prints total

```ts
const usPayment = new PaymentProcessor(new USTax());
usPayment.processPayment(1000);
```
Now we‚Äôre passing a different strategy, but the same processor logic works

Tax and total are calculated differently

üß† Why This Pattern is Awesome:
1. Clean code ‚Äî no big tax switch logic anywhere
2. Each country has its own file or class ‚Äî isolated logic
3. Easy to test ‚Äî test IndiaTax without touching payment logic
4. Easy to extend ‚Äî want to add DubaiTax tomorrow? Just create a class, done.
