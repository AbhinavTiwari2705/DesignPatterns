# Design Patterns

This repository contains implementations of various **design patterns** commonly used in software development.

---

### 📁 Repository Structure
```
repo/
|── PatternName/
│ ├── README.md # Explanation of the pattern
│ └── PatternName.ts # Code implementation (separate from README)
├── AnotherPattern/
│ ├── README.md
│ └── PatternName.ts

```

Each folder is named after a specific design pattern (e.g., `Strategy`, `Observer`, `Factory`, etc.).

Inside each folder:

- `README.md` contains a clear explanation of the pattern, its use cases, and how it works.
- Code implementation is defined separately in files like `index.ts` or `index.js` for better modularity and readability.
